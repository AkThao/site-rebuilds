# Site Rebuilds
A practice ground for rebuilding real-world websites to sharpen my web dev skills.
The goal is not to create pixel-perfect replicas, but rather create something that looks as close as possible to the original without looking at any of the source code.

The following is a list of websites I am studying and rebuilding as part of this project:
- Anki: https://apps.ankiweb.net/
- Dovetail: https://dovetail.com/
- ETF Atlas: https://etfatlas.com/
- Shift Nudge: https://shiftnudge.com/
